Randomized delay based on difficulty and start timing:

```js
const base = { easy: 1500, normal: 2000, hard: 3000 }[prefs.difficulty || 'normal'];
const delay = rand(500, base);
this.timeoutId = setTimeout(() => {
  this.state = 'go';
  this.startTime = performance.now();
  this.els.pad.className = 'pad go';
  this.els.padText.textContent = 'GO!';
